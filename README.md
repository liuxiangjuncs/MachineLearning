## Notation & Format of Data

By default, there are N training data points. And independent parameter $x$ of each data point (after **pre-processing** via **basic function**, usually have a leading 1) is a column vector consists of M scalar values. All dependent parameter $Y$ consists of all N scalar values.

And independent data matrix $A$ is a  N * M matrix, each row represents a data point after pre-processing.
